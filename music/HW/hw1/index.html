	The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), 
	sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, 
	is a semiaquatic egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. 
	Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five extant species of monotremes, 
	<img src="images/platypusLeft.png" align="left">
	<img src="images/platypusRight.png" align="right">
	the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth. 
	The animal is the sole living representative of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus), 
	though a number of related species have been found in the fossil record. The first preserved platypus body was thought to have been a fake,
	made of several animals sewn together, when it was first looked at by scientists in 1799.
	
	The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, o
	tter-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it, 
	with some considering it an elaborate hoax. It is one of the few species of venomous mammals: 
	the male platypus having a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom capable of causing severe pain to humans. 
	The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia; 
	it has appeared as a mascot at national events and is featured on the reverse of its 20-cent coin. 
	The platypus is the animal emblem of the state of New South Wales.[5]
